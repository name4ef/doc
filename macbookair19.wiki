=== getting rid of turning on the monitor every minute in suspended mode (in work)===
I think this trouble of inappropriate work of some driver at USB-C bus.
==== trying disable thunderbolt drivers ====
- reboot and go to recovery mode (hold *Command+R*)
- `csrutil disable; reboot`
- `csrutil status # check of SIP (System Integrity Protection) state`
- for remount FS for write mode may use: `mount -u -w /dev/disk3s5`
- for disable driver some remove rights for read:
  `chmod a-r /System/Library/Extensions/AppleThunderboltDPAdapters.kext`
  but after reboot it's by default again...
- for unload some use something like this:
  `kextunload /System/Library/Extensions/AppleThunderboltDPAdapters.kext`
  but in best choise I get that driver is in usage...
- `kextutil kextstat kextload kmodunload` - some analog for `lsmod modins` and so on
